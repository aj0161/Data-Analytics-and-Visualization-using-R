1.Use linear regression to predict profit based on all available numeric variables. Graph the train and test MSE as a function of the train set size (averaged over 10 random data partitions as described above)?
2. Try to improve the prediction quality in (1) as much as possible by adding feature transformations of the numeric variables. Explore both numeric transformations such as power transforms and non-numeric transformations of the numeric variables like binning (e.g., is_budget_greater_than_3M). Explain which transformations you used and why you chose them. Graph the train and test MSE as a function of the train set size (averaged over 10 random data partitions as described above)?
3. Write code that featurizes genre (can use code from Part-I), actors, directors, and other categorical variables. Explain how you encoded the variables into features.
4. Use linear regression to predict profit based on all available non-numeric variables (using the transformations in (3). Graph the train and test MSE as a function of the train set size (averaged over 10 random data partitions as described above)?
5. Try to improve the prediction quality in (1) as much as possible by using both numeric and non- numeric variables as well as creating additional transformed features including interaction features (for example is_genre_comedy x is_budget_greater_than_3M). Explain which transformations you used and why you chose them. Graph the train and test MSE as a function of the train set size (averaged over 10 random data partitions as described above)?
